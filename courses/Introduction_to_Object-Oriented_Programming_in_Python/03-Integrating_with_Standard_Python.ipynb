    "When comparing two objects of a custom class using ==, Python by default compares just the memory chunks that the objects point to, not the data contained in the objects. To override this behavior, the class can implement a special method, which accepts two arguments, the objects to be compared, and returns True or False. This method will be implicitly called when two objects are compared.\n",
