    "## Creating a SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this exercise, you'll spin up a local Spark cluster using all available cores. The cluster will be accessible via a SparkSession object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SparkSession class has a builder attribute, which is an instance of the Builder class. The Builder class exposes three important methods that let you:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -    specify the location of the master node;\n",
    "    -    name the application (optional); and\n",
    "    -    retrieve an existing SparkSession or, if there is none, create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SparkSession class has a version attribute which gives the version of Spark. Note: The version can also be accessed via the __version__ attribute on the pyspark module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find out more about SparkSession <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SparkSession\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you are finished with the cluster, it's a good idea to shut it down, which will free up its resources, making them available for other processes.\n",

    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-    You might find it useful to review the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.\n",
    "-    The version of Spark in the exercise is not the same as in the lessons. The exercise platform has been updated to a more recent version of Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "-    Import the SparkSession class from pyspark.sql.\n",
    "-    Create a SparkSession object connected to a local cluster. Use all available cores. Name the application 'test'.\n",
    "-    Use the version attribute on the SparkSession object to retrieve the version of Spark running on the cluster. Note: The version might be different to the one that's used in the presentation (it gets updated from time to time).\n",
    "-    Shut down the cluster."
