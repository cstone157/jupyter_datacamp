    "A common challenge with real-world ratings data is that most users will not have rated most items, and most items will only have been rated by a small number of users. This results in a very empty or sparse DataFrame.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will calculate how sparse the movie_lens ratings data is by counting the number of occupied cells and compare it to the size of the full DataFrame. The DataFrame user_ratings_df that you have used in previous exercises, containing a row per user and a column per movie, has been loaded for you.\n",
