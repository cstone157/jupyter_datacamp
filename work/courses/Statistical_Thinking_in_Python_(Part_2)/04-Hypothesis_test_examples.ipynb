    "The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed in the USA. Excluding \"present\" and \"abstain\" votes, 153 House Democrats and 136 Republicans voted yea. However, 91 Democrats and 35 Republicans voted nay. Did party affiliation make a difference in the vote?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, you will evaluate the hypothesis that the party of a House member has no bearing on his or her vote. You will use the fraction of Democrats voting in favor as your test statistic and evaluate the probability of observing a fraction of Democrats voting in favor at least as small as the observed fraction of 153/244. (That's right, at least as small as. In 1964, it was the Democrats who were less progressive on civil rights issues.) To do this, permute the party labels of the House voters and then arbitrarily divide them into \"Democrats\" and \"Republicans\" and compute the fraction of Democrats voting yea.\n",

    "    - Use your draw_perm_reps() function to draw 10,000 permutation replicates of the fraction of Democrat yea votes.\n",

Importantly, the pitcher was no longer allowed to spit on or scuff the ball, an activity that greatly favors pitchers. In this problem you will perform an A/B test to determine if these rule changes resulted in a slower rate of no-hitters (i.e., longer average time between no-hitters) using the difference in mean inter-no-hitter time as your test statistic. The inter-no-hitter times for the respective eras are stored in the arrays nht_dead and nht_live, where \"nht\" is meant to stand for \"no-hitter time.\"\n",
