    "## Queries on a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know some basic properties of the graph and have practiced using NetworkX's drawing facilities to visualize components of it, it's time to explore how you can query it for nodes and edges. Specifically, you're going to look for \"nodes of interest\" and \"edges of interest\". To achieve this, you'll make use of the .nodes() and .edges() methods that Eric went over in the video. The .nodes() method returns a Node view iterable, while the .edges() method returns an edge view iterable, in which each tuple shows the nodes that are present on that edge. Recall that passing in the keyword argument data=True in these methods retrieves the corresponding metadata associated with the nodes and edges as well.\n",
    "\n",

    "        - The iterator variable d is a dictionary. The key of interest here is 'occupation' and value of interest is 'scientist'.\n",
    "    - Use a list comprehension to get a list of edges from the graph T that were formed for at least 6 years, i.e., from before 1 Jan 2010.\n",
