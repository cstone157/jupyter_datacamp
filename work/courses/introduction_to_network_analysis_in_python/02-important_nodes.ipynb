    "How do you evaluate whether a node is an important one or not? There are a few ways to do so, and here, you're going to look at one metric: the number of neighbors that a node has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every NetworkX graph G exposes a .neighbors(n) method that returns an iterator of nodes that are the neighbors of the node n. To begin, use this method in the IPython Shell on the Twitter network T to get the neighbors of of node 1. This will get you familiar with how the function works. Then, your job in this exercise is to write a function that returns all nodes that have m neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "    - Write a function called nodes_with_m_nbrs() that has two parameters - G and m - and returns all nodes that have m neighbors. To do this:\n",
    "        - Iterate over all nodes in G (not including the metadata).\n",
    "        - Use the len() and list() functions together with the .neighbors() method to calculate the total number of neighbors that node n in graph G has.\n",
    "            - If the number of neighbors of node n is equal to m, add n to the set nodes using the .add() method.\n",
    "        - After iterating over all the nodes in G, return the set nodes.\n",
    "    - Use your nodes_with_m_nbrs() function to retrieve all the nodes that have 6 neighbors in the graph T."
