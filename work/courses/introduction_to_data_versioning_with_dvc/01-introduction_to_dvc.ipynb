    "Now, you will reinforce your understanding of how data influences the model performance. You will be working with the Airbnb booking dataset (in the file booking.csv). The dataset is suited for classification tasks to predict if someone would cancel a booking. It contains several numerical and categorical columns. You will split the provided dataset into three mutually exclusive samples - train_A.csv, train_B.csv, and test.csv - using split_dataset.py script. Further, for each training dataset, you'll run the data processing and model training pipeline to train a Random Forest Classifier model and test its performance on the test set by using model_training.py. The hyperparameters defined in params.json are consistent in both runs.\n",

In this exercise, you'll create a Git repository, create a new branch, add an initial file, and make your first commit. These foundational Git commands will help you later when we apply them in conjunction with DVC. You can expand on this exercise by adding more files, creating more branches, and committing those changes to further your understanding.\n",
